# Digital Marketplace front-end toolkit changelog

Records breaking changes from major version bumps
## 23.0.0

PR

## What changed

- GOV.UK Elements is now a dependency and will need to be added to package.json for frontend apps.


## 22.0.0

PR: [#313](https://github.com/alphagov/digitalmarketplace-frontend-toolkit/pull/313)

## What changed

- The `fake-full-width` [Sass mixin](http://sass-lang.com/guide#topic-6) is now required to compile the `_pricing.scss` file.
  This means a new shared placeholder in the apps that use the frontend toolkit

## 21.0.0

PR: [#304](https://github.com/alphagov/digitalmarketplace-frontend-toolkit/pull/304)

### What changed

- The format of the followup questions has changed, so toolkit form macros need to pass in
  the `content_question.values_followup` instead of the `content_question.followup`
- Since radio and checkbox questions can have followups too the related macros need to set
  `followup=content_question.values_followup`
- Radio, boolean and list-entry questions can be follow-up questions, so related macros
  need to set `hidden=question_content.hidden`
- We need to vendor a version of `show-hide-content.js` with added support for multiple
  follow-up inputs, so it has to be used instead of the GOV.UK toolkit one
- The IDs for input elements (e.g. booleans) now has a numeric suffix rather than a string
  (e.g. yes/no -> 1/2)

### Example app change

#### Loading the `show-hide-content.js` with support for multiple follow-up questions

Old:
```
//= include ../../../node_modules/govuk_frontend_toolkit/javascripts/govuk/show-hide-content.js
```

New:
```
//= include ../../../bower_components/digitalmarketplace-frontend-toolkit/toolkit/javascripts/show-hide-content.js
```

#### Updating application `form_toolkit` macros

Old:
```jinja
{% macro boolean(question_content, service_data, errors, question_number=None, get_question=None) -%}
  {%
     with
     ...
     followup=question_content.followup,
     ...
  %}
    {% include "toolkit/forms/selection-buttons.html" %}
  {% endwith %}
{%- endmacro %}
```

New:
```jinja
{% macro boolean(question_content, service_data, errors, question_number=None, get_question=None) -%}
  {%
     with
     ...
     followup=question_content.values_followup,
     hidden=question_content.hidden,
     ...
  %}
    {% include "toolkit/forms/selection-buttons.html" %}
  {% endwith %}
{%- endmacro %}
```

#### Updating tests

Old:
```assert len(doc.xpath("//*[@id='input-yesNo-" + str(i) + "-yes']")) == 1```

New:
```assert len(doc.xpath("//*[@id='input-yesNo-" + str(i) + "-1']")) == 1```


## 20.0.0

PR: [#302](https://github.com/alphagov/digitalmarketplace-frontend-toolkit/pull/302)

## What changed

We've updated the govuk_frontend_toolkit, so most of these changes are driven from that.
The good news is that the changes are very minor and mostly don't affect our frontend apps.

- The selected and focused classes for our selection buttons are now just `.selected` and `.focused` instead of what they were before (`.selection-button-focused` and `.selection-button-selected`, respectively).

#### Breaking change

Old:
```ruby
find(
    :xpath,
    "//*[contains(text(), 'Service status')]/following-sibling::*[@class='selection-button selection-button-selected'][text()]"
  ).text().should have_content("#{service_status}")

```

New:
```ruby
find(
    :xpath,
    "//*[contains(text(), 'Service status')]/following-sibling::*[@contains(@class, 'selection-button selected')][text()]"
  ).text().should have_content("#{service_status}")
```

<br />
<br />

- The `.question-heading-with-hint` class has been deprecated because our vertical spacing for question meta elements doesn't care about this distinction anymore.

#### Breaking change

Old:
```jinja
{{ form.email_address.label(class="question-heading-with-hint") }}
```

New:
```jinja
{{ form.email_address.label(class="question-heading") }}
```

<br />
<br />

The following are also changes to classnames but they don't appear to be in the frontend apps.
Means we don't have to worry about them, happily.

- The `.selection-button-boolean` class has been removed in favour of `.selection-button-radio`, which is consistent with those in [govuk_elements](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements/blob/677f7cfd009cd8035aa856ea0456c9fcf3c9e18e/app/views/snippets/form_radio_inline_yes_no.html#L11).

- The `phase-banner` stuff no longer has phase-dependent colours.  Means we no longer have `.phase-banner-alpha` and `.phase-banner-beta` classes, but simply `.phase-banner`.


## 19.0.0

PR: [#285](https://github.com/alphagov/digitalmarketplace-frontend-toolkit/pull/285)

## What changed

- The `beta-banner` pattern has been renamed to `phase-banner`.  This will affect exactly nothing because nobody has ever used the `beta-banner` pattern, but I guess technically this is a breaking change.

#### Breaking changes

Old:
```jinja
{% import toolkit/beta-banner.html %}
```

New:
```jinja
{% import toolkit/phase-banner.html %}
```


## 18.0.0

PR: [#286](https://github.com/alphagov/digitalmarketplace-frontend-toolkit/pull/286)

### What changed

- Removed the `|markdown` and `|safe` filters from being used by templates.
Going forward, none of the templates will allow literal HTML or markdown in passed-in strings; instead, our apps will be responsible for processing values before they get to the templates.
- Removed two outdated patterns that we've stopped using.

#### Templates where `|safe` has been removed

- `beta-banner`
- `browse-list`
- `notification-banner`
- `search-summary`
- `temporary-message`

#### Templates where `|markdown` has been removed

- `list-entry`
- `pricing`
- `selection-buttons`
- `textbox`
- `upload`

#### Templates which have been removed altogether

- `framework-notice`
- `search-results`


## 17.0.0

PR: [#270](https://github.com/alphagov/digitalmarketplace-frontend-toolkit/pull/270)

### What changed

- Added the option for first field of summary tables to be two-thirds width.

#### Breaking changes

Changed `.summary-item-field-first-wider` style to `.summary-item-field-first-half` for summary tables.

Any fontend apps that explicitly call `.summary-item-field-first-wider` will need to change to use
`.summary-item-field-first-half` instead.

## 16.0.0

PR: [#268](https://github.com/alphagov/digitalmarketplace-frontend-toolkit/pull/268)

### What changed

- Removed `extra` key from instruction list; using `top` and `bottom` keys instead [in
  #268](https://github.com/alphagov/digitalmarketplace-frontend-toolkit/pull/268)

#### Breaking changes

In order to have more flexibility when building our instruction list items, we removed the `extra` key in favour of `top` and `bottom` keys.

Adding a `top` will create an unstyled paragraph as the first thing in an instruction list section.  Adding a `bottom` will create a paragraph with `top-margin` of `10px` as the almost last thing in an instruction list section (if you include an `important` key, that one will be the final thing in a section).


## 15.0.0

PR: [#213](https://github.com/alphagov/digitalmarketplace-frontend-toolkit/pull/213)

### What changed

- new notification banner format
  [#211](https://github.com/alphagov/digitalmarketplace-frontend-toolkit/pull/211)
(breaking change)
- changes to temporary messages example page
  [#212](https://github.com/alphagov/digitalmarketplace-frontend-toolkit/pull/212)
- separation of temporary message style into
  placeholder [in
- ability to add pattern-level grids [in
  #212](https://github.com/alphagov/digitalmarketplace-frontend-toolkit/pull/212)

#### Breaking changes

The base temporary message styles were split out into a placeholder block to allow use across multiple patterns (by [extending](https://github.com/alphagov/digitalmarketplace-frontend-toolkit/blob/master/toolkit/scss/_notification-banners.scss#L69) it):

https://github.com/alphagov/digitalmarketplace-frontend-toolkit/blob/master/toolkit/scss/shared_placeholders/_temporary-messages.scss

This means the existing temporary message pattern will break unless the new placeholder block is included in the main stylesheet of apps that use it.
