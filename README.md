# Digital Marketplace front-end toolkit documentation

Documentation for the toolkit code is in the form of Github pages kept on this branch.

## Generating the documentation pages

The documentation pages can be generated by following these steps.

### Requirements

- Python
- [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/)
- [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)

### Set up a virtualenv

To set up an isolated environment for the project, run this command.

```
virtualenv ~/Envs/digitalmarketplace-frontend_toolkit
```

Note: you can set the virtualenv to any location on your system by swapping out `~/Envs/digitalmarketplace-frontend_toolkit` to your choice of folder.

### Install the dependancies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Generate the pages

```
python build_tools/publish-gh-page.py
```

## Workflow considerations

### CSS image paths

In order to allow one path, whether working locally or on `origin gh-pages`, all images referenced in the CSS are assumed to be on the github pages server.

For example, the file `breadcrumb-separator.png` is referenced as `http://alphagov.github.io/digitalmarketplace-frontend-toolkit/images/breadcrumb-separator.png`.
