      To find the best specialist to meet your needs, you should:

      - list as many types of skills and experience as you can
      - be specific about the skills and experience you're looking for

      If too many suppliers have all the essential skills and experience, you’ll use the nice-to-have skills and
      experience to exclude suppliers.

      You must tell suppliers if you want to score individual criteria.
