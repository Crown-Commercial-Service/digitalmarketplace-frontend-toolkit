# Accordion

## Installation

See the [main README quick start guide](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend#quick-start) for how to install this component.

## Guidance and Examples

Find out when to use the details component in your service in the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/accordion).

## Component options

Use options to customise the appearance, content and behaviour of a component when using a macro, for example, changing the text.

`id` option given to instances of the component must be **unique** across the domain of your service (as the expanded state of individual instances of the component persists across page loads using [`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)).

See [options table](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/accordion/#options-example-default) for details.
